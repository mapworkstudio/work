                                                In an increasingly competitive business world, manpower requirements pose a challenge that requires a careful allocation of resources to overcome. Recruitments come with a host of resource intensive issues such as Sourcing, Appointing, Compensation, Payroll Management, Statutory Compliances, Employee Benefits and Exit Management.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Temporary Staffing, or Temping, is an effective solution to these hassles. It basically defines a 3-way relationship between the Employer, Temping Consultant and Employee. Within this definition, we manage and administer projects on behalf of companies that require personnel for short term contracts of 6 months to a 2 year contract term. We cater to companies involved in major projects and organizations that may be facing increased workload or headcount. We assist such clients by recruiting staff for the project and overseeing the administrative and logistic requirements throughout the agreed term.
