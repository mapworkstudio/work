It defines the scope of testing and documents the process of quality assurance.\n                                            <img src=\"assets/images/managservice/qa-testing.png\" align=\"right\">\n                                        </p>\n                                        <p class=\"running-text manage-space\">Arkedge helps with critical aspects of clients' systems, such as planning, process control, performance metrics, test automation, test execution, defect tracking, and reporting.\n                                        </p>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div *ngFor=\"let data of qaInfo\" class=\"col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 qa-info\">\n                                        <div class=\"panel\">\n                                                <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                                                   <h6>{{data.title}}</h6>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                                    <p>{{data.info}}</p>\n                                                </div>\n                                         </div>\n                                    </div>\n\n                                </div>\n\n                                <div class=\"row qa-testing-info\">\n                                  <div class=\"col-md-4 col-lg-4 col-sm-12 v-flex\">\n                                        <div class=\"icon-circle\">\n                                            <i class=\"icon icon-large\">\n                                                <svg focusable=\"false\">\n                                                    <use xlink:href=\"#icon_seeting3\"></use>\n                                                </svg>\n                                            </i>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-lg-8 col-sm-12\">\n                                        <h6>Functional Testing</h6>\n                                        <p>Functional testing is done using the functional specifications provided by the client or by using the design specifications like use cases provided by the design team.

It basically defines a 3-way relationship between the Employer, Temping Consultant and Employee. Within this definition, we manage and administer projects on behalf of companies that require personnel for short term contracts of 6 months to a 2 year contract term. We cater to companies involved in major projects and organizations that may be facing increased workload or headcount.
