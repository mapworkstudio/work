It defines the scope of testing and documents the process of quality assurance.\n                                            <img src=\"assets/images/managservice/qa-testing.png\" align=\"right\">\n                                        </p>\n                                        <p class=\"running-text manage-space\">Arkedge helps with critical aspects of clients' systems, such as planning, process control, performance metrics, test automation, test execution, defect tracking, and reporting.\n                                        </p>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div *ngFor=\"let data of qaInfo\" class=\"col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 qa-info\">\n                                        <div class=\"panel\">\n                                                <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                                                   <h6>{{data.title}}</h6>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                                    <p>{{data.info}}</p>\n                                                </div>\n                                         </div>\n                                    </div>\n\n                                </div>\n\n                                <div class=\"row qa-testing-info\">\n                                  <div class=\"col-md-4 col-lg-4 col-sm-12 v-flex\">\n                                        <div class=\"icon-circle\">\n                                            <i class=\"icon icon-large\">\n                                                <svg focusable=\"false\">\n                                                    <use xlink:href=\"#icon_seeting3\"></use>\n                                                </svg>\n                                            </i>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-lg-8 col-sm-12\">\n                                        <h6>Functional Testing</h6>\n                                        <p>Functional testing is done using the functional specifications provided by the client or by using the design specifications like use cases provided by the design team.

Recruitments come with a host of resource intensive issues such as Sourcing, Appointing, Compensation, Payroll Management, Statutory Compliances, Employee Benefits and Exit Management.\n                                                <br><br>\n                                                Temporary Staffing, or Temping, is an effective solution to these hassles. It basically defines a 3-way relationship between the Employer, Temping Consultant and Employee. Within this definition, we manage and administer projects on behalf of companies that require personnel for short term contracts of 6 months to a 2 year contract term. We cater to companies involved in major projects and organizations that may be facing increased workload or headcount. We assist such clients by recruiting staff for the project and overseeing the administrative and logistic requirements throughout the agreed term.\n                                            </p>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </section>\n                        </ng-template>\n                    </li>\n                    <li [ngbNavItem]=\"2\">\n                        <a ngbNavLink>Staff Service Industry</a>\n                        <ng-template ngbNavContent>\n                            <section class=\"section-staffing\">\n                                <div class=\"container\">\n                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                        <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\n                                            <p class=\"running-text\">\n                                                We ensure excellence in service through understanding of our client's business and their unique requirements.
